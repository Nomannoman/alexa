Alexa is basically a nice chatbot which was made by me and Gautam __
It basically takes an input and gives output based on the aiml file __
The workflow is pretty simple there are two options as raising a ticket and buying a plan __
Its built using aiml (Artificial Intelligence Markup Langauge ) and deployed on pandorabots.com __
You could just put this code inside a pandorabots file and deploy and it would start working __

Thanks,__
