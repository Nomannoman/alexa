Alexa is basically a nice chatbot which was made by me and Gautam\n
It basically takes an input and gives output based on the aiml file\n
The workflow is pretty simple there are two options as raising a ticket and buying a plan\n
Its built using aiml (Artificial Intelligence Markup Langauge ) and deployed on pandorabots.com\n
You could just put this code inside a pandorabots file and deploy and it would start working\n

Thanks,\n
