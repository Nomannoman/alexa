Alexa is basically a nice chatbot which was made by me and Gautam  
It basically takes an input and gives output based on the aiml file  
The workflow is pretty simple there are two options as raising a ticket and buying a plan  
Its built using aiml (Artificial Intelligence Markup Langauge ) and deployed on pandorabots.com  
You could just put this code inside a pandorabots file and deploy and it would start working  

Thanks,
